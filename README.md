Flash Card Vocabulary Learning App:

This Python application uses a graphical interface to help users learn French vocabulary by presenting virtual flash cards. Users can flip cards to reveal English translations, mark words as known or unknown, and their progress is saved for future learning sessions. The app aims to make language learning engaging and interactive.
